# Traffic Accident Prediction and Deployment

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting traffic accidents using historical data and deploying the trained model. Two machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest, were implemented and compared for accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset, "Monatszahlen Verkehrsunf채lle," obtained from the M체nchen Open Data Portal, contains detailed information about accidents, including categories, types, years, and months.

## Mission 1: AI Model

### Linear Regression and Random Forest

Implemented machine learning models to predict traffic accidents for the category 'Alkoholunf채lle' and the accident type 'insgesamt' in the year 2021 and month 01. Evaluated the performance of both Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms, with Random Forest showing superior accuracy.

## Visualization

Utilized data visualization techniques to illustrate the historical trends of accidents per category. Specifically, the focus was on the 'Alkoholunf채lle' category.

## Mission 2: Publish and Deploy

### GitHub Repository

The complete source code and visualizations are available in the [GitHub repository]([https://github.com/agoswami31/dps-ai-task/blob/main/dps-challenge.ipynb]).

### Deployment

Deployed the trained model on AWS. The model's endpoint accepts JSON input, containing the year and month, and returns accident predictions.
